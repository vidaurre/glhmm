                "GLHMM is a Python toolbox with a focus on neuroscience applications but broadly applicable to other domains as well. It implements a generalisation of various types of Hidden Markov Model ([HMM](../glossary.html#hmm)). The toolbox can be applied on multiple data modalities, including fMRI, EEG, MEG, and ECoG, and offers a comprehensive set of HMMs tailored for different data types and analysis goals. The most important configurable aspect is the state distribution, which is parameterized using a regression model. A non-exhaustive list of possible state distributions are: \n",

                "- `Wishart`: employed in fMRI to specifically focus on changes in connectivity (covariance).\n",
                "- `Time-delay embedded`: applied to whole-brain electrophysiological data (MEG or EEG), to capture spectral modulations in the data.\n",
                "- `Autoregressive`: provides a more detailed spectral description for electrophysiological data with a limited number of channels.\n",
                "- `Regression-based decoding`: describes the dynamic relationship between brain activity and ongoing stimuli.\n",
